Kenji-X1  has open-source APIs and widely available components on the market to help everyone (students, developers and makers) jump-start into tele-robotics development. 
We have equipped Kenji-X1 with payload containers, retractable and flexible multi-segment manipulators, grippers to handle, carry, load/unload objects.
Kenji-X1 is modular! … and doesn’t have a unibody construction as the most market solutions therefore you can configure it according to your applications demand. 
Design inspired by nature and “decapod crustaceans” lifeforms, aka ocean crab, which is naturally evolved to be agile in numerous challenging terrains (sea, seashores, sandy beaches, rocks, caves).
